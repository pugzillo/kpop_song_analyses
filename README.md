# Kpop Song Analyses: 
A statistical analysis of Korean pop (K-pop) music from 2000-2019.

## Background: 
K-pop is a genre of popular music from South Korea. However, to confine K-pop to just music is too simplistic. It is a fusion of music, visual art and fashion. Though K-pop has origins in the early 90s, modern K-pop truly emerged in the 2000s. K-pop artists tend to perform in boy or girl groups produced by large companies. 

Despite songs being in korean, the impact of K-pop is has gone beyond it's native borders and gone worldwide.
