# Kpop Song Analyses: 
A statistical analysis of Korean pop (K-pop) music from 2000-2019.

## Background: 
K-pop is a genre of popular music from South Korea. However, to confine K-pop to just music is too simplistic. It is a fusion of music, visual art and fashion. Though K-pop has origins in the early 90s, modern K-pop truly emerged in the 2000s. K-pop artists tend to perform in boy or girl groups produced by large companies. 

Despite songs being in korean, the impact of K-pop is has gone beyond it's native borders and gone worldwide.

## Hypotheses:
I'm interested in the musical song features that may contribute to the success of K-pop in the west. 

## Dataset:
Wikipedia was scraped to obtain a list of kpop artists that have debuted from 2000-2019 (cut off: Sept 7, 2019, n = 378), along with information concerning the gender, debut year, and record company. Pudding (https://pudding.cool/2018/11/boy-bands/) was scraped to obtain a list of western boybands (n = 103) who have charted on the Billboard Hot 100 since 1980. The Spotify API was used to download all the song features for the discography.
